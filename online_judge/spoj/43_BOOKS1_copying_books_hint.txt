	In some sense this is a classical problem - both for DP and greedy.

The greedy approach works approximately like this:

1. Do a binary search on the maximal number of pages that a single scribe
will be assigned. We are trying to minimize this number.
2. For every number fixed by the binary search check greedily if the scribes
can cope with it.

Since step 2 is done in linear time the overall coplexity is n * log(p) -
n is the number of the books, p - the sum of the pages in all books.
The straightforward DP is n^2 * k (k is the number of scribes).

A very similar greedy approach solves also the following problem:
