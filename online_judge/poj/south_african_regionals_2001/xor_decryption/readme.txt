Four different input test sets (input1-4.txt) are provided. They all yield
the same output file, output.txt.
A sample text file, sample.txt, is provided. This file should be given to
the students to help them solve the problem. Note that sample.txt is not
encrypted; the students should use their own encryptor to first encrypt it
before testing their decryptors on the resulting file.
